# Italian Geospatial Lookups for Splunk

This Splunk app contains the geospatial lookups `geo_it_regions` and `geo_it_provinces` for Italian
regions and provinces.

The nomenclature follows `iplocation`'s *Region* field, which may contain a mix of first- and
second-level administrative divisions (respectively regions and provinces).
The lookups `geo_attr_it_regions` and `geo_attr_it_provinces` are useful for data normalization
and display.
The macros `geom_it_regions` and `geom_it_provinces` provide an example of how to use them.
